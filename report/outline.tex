\section{Outline}

The translation from Haskell to First Order Logic is described in
Chapter \ref{ch:translation}. The problem is first tackled with a
naive but straightforward attempt that fails and is then resolved. The
different sections described different aspects of Haskell, such as
pattern matching and higher order functions.  Section
\ref{sec:domaintheory} covers the mere basics of domain theory that is
relevant for this translation and for the induction techniques.  The
Chapter is concluded with future work of parts not currently covered.

The proof techniques this tool uses are described in Chapter
\ref{ch:proofs}. Four different techniques are described and the
outline in that chapter will guide you further. Each technique is
explained, exemplified and proved or motivated to be correct.

The results of using this translation and the proof techniques on a
test suite are and discussion is in Chapter \ref{ch:results}. The
different techniques are compared and the results are discussed.
Chapter \ref{ch:future} describes possible future work and the last
Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes the thesis by looking back at
what we have accomplished.
