\section{Structural induction}

Any non-recursive, or more importantly recursive data type gives rise
to induction schemata.

\footnote{Haskell's natural numbers are of course also cluttered with
  elements that are not natural numbers, such as $\bot$, but also the
  infinite ``natural number'' defined by \hs{infinite = Succ infinite}}
, defined the usual way in Haskell by \hs{data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat}
yields this induction axiom schema:

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule*
     {
       P(\fn{Zero})
       \\
       \fa{x} P(x) \rightarrow P(\fn{Succ}(x))
     }
     { \fa{x} P(x) }
\end{mathpar}
