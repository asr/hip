  abstract = {Recursion is a well-known and powerful programming
     technique, with a wide variety of applications.  The dual technique
     of corecursion is less well-known, but is increasingly proving to be
     just as useful.  This article is a tutorial on the four main methods
     for proving properties of corecursive programs: fixpoint induction,
     the approximation (or take) lemma, coinduction, and fusion.}
