This Master thesis gives a new tool to automatically verify properties
written in the functional programming language Haskell, with the aim
to be able to reason about infinite and partial values available in
Haskell from general recursion and lazy data structures. The novelty
of this approach is to use automated theorem provers for first order
logic so this tool includes a translation from Haskell to first order
theories. The properties are instantiated with different induction
techniques applicable to non strict functional languages: structural
induction, fixed point induction and the approximation lemma. As the
target logic is untyped, Haskell features such as pattern matching and
higher order functions needs to be dealt with special care. The
results from using the tool on a test suite are convincing as the
automated provers quickly deduce theorems for a variety of
properties. To be able to compete on fair grounds with contemporary
tools a system for adding lemmas would be required, which turned out
to be difficult as theorems for finite and infinite values do not coexist
peacefully out of the box.
