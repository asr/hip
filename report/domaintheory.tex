\section{Domain Theory}
\label{sec:domaintheory}

This section is stand alone, and could be skipped especially if you
already know the basics of Domain Theory: comp\-lete partial orders,
monotonicity and continuity.
It explains these concepts and discusses how it can be
used to verify the translation, furthermore it is used as a reference
in the future sections that rely on concepts from domain theory.

The values of every data type are ordered on how much ``information''
they contain. The least element bottom, denoted $\bot$, contains least
information. It corresponds to all kinds of crashes in Haskell; use of
\hs{undefined}, non-termination or non exhausite pattern matches.
Different constructors hold different information, so they are not
related by the ordering; this is a partial order, a relation that is
reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric. The ordering is usually
written $\sqsubseteq$ sometimes with a subscript indicating the type.

For the \hs{Bool} data type the partial order can be drawn as a Hasse
Diagram and this can be shown in Figure \ref{fig:boolcpo}.  From the
picture it is understood that $\bot$ is the least element, and the
line from it to \hs{False} means that $\bot \sqsubseteq \hs{False}$,
since $\bot$ is below $\hs{False}$. Correspondingly for $\hs{True}$,
the diagram tells us that $\bot \sqsubseteq \hs{True}$. It can also
been seen that $\hs{True} \nsqsubseteq \hs{False}$; they are unrelated
since there is no line between them.

For tuples and other constructors that take other data types as
parameters, the ordering is:
\begin{equation*}
\hstup{x_0}{y_0} \sqsubseteq_{(a,b)} \hstup{x_1}{y_1} \text{\quad iff \quad}
x_0 \sqsubseteq_a x_1 \text{\w and \w} y_0 \sqsubseteq_b y_1
\end{equation*}

The Hasse Diagram for the \hs{(Bool,Bool)} values can be seen in
Figure \ref{fig:boolboolcpo}. Here \hs{True} is abbreviated for \hs{T}
and similarly for \hs{False}. It is not flat as the one for \hs{Bool};
it can be seen as three dimensional. On the lowest layer the only
value is $\bot$, on the next layer $\hstup{\bot}{\bot}$. Above that
the tuples with one $\bot$, and finally the total values at the
top.

\subsection{Monotonicity}
 An important property all safe Haskell functions have is that they are
monotone with respect to this ordering.

\paragraph{Definition} A function $f$ is \emph{monotone} iff

\begin{equation*}
\faa{x}{y} \quad x \sqsubseteq y \quad \Rightarrow \quad f(x) \sqsubseteq f(y).
\end{equation*}

This can be understood in many ways. One way to see it is if you have
two inputs to a function, one containing \emph{less} information that
the other, i.e. more bottoms, it is impossible to return \emph{more}
information from the input with less information.

\newpage

One simple example of a consequence of this is the impossibility to
make a function \hs{isBottom :: a -> Bool}, returning \hs{True} if the
argument is bottom, and \hs{False} otherwise:

\note{rewrite with code}
\begin{align*}
& \hs{isBottom} \w :: \hs{a} \rightarrow \hs{Bool} \\
& \hs{isBottom} \w \bot = \hs{True} \\
& \hs{isBottom} \w x \, = \hs{False}, \qquad x \neq \bot
\end{align*}

\noindent
Since $\bot \sqsubseteq x$ for any $x$, then by monotonicity we must
necessarily have
$$\hs{isBottom} \w \bot \sqsubseteq \hs{isBottom} \w x.$$
Take any non-bottom $x$, and this equation gives
$\hs{True} \sqsubseteq \hs{False}$, which is false. Hence
\hs{isBottom} is not monotone.

\subsection{Continuity}
Another domain theoretic property that Haskell functions have is that
they are continuous. This is a property that gives us insight in how
functions behave on infinite input.  To describe this, we need to
consider the partial order of a data type with infinite values. The
prime candidate \hs{data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat} is used and Hasse
Diagram can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:natcpo}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\input{natcpo}
\caption{
    The (complete) partial order for \texttt{Nat}, with \hs{inf = Succ inf.}
    \label{fig:natcpo}
}
\end{figure}

At the top we have the infinite value \hs{inf}, defined in Haskell as
\hs{inf = Succ inf}. Here \hs{inf} is the \emph{limit} of an
$\omega$-chain, i.e a chain with the same number of elements as
$\omega$, the natural numbers. The chain is:

\begin{equation*}
\bot \sqsubseteq
\hs{Succ} \, \bot \sqsubseteq
\hs{Succ} \, (\hs{Succ} \, \bot) \sqsubseteq
\hs{Succ} \, (\hs{Succ} \, (\hs{Succ} \, \bot)) \sqsubseteq
\cdots
\end{equation*}

This chain could succinctly be written $\langle \hs{Succ}^n \, \bot
\rangle_{n \in \omega}$.  Here $\hs{Succ}^n$ means $n$ applications of
the \hs{Succ} constructor. The limit is written $\lub{n \in
  \omega}(\hs{Succ}^n \, \bot)$ and is equal to \hs{inf}, where
$\lub{}$ is the least upper bound. All elements in the chain satisfy
the property of being less than or equal to the limit: $\hs{Succ}^n \,
\bot \sqsubseteq \hs{inf}$.

A partial order is a complete partial order iff there is a limit for
every $\omega$ chain. All data types in Haskell are complete partial
orders\footnote{Notice that the data type \hs{data StrictNat = Zero |
    Succ !StrictNat} is flat and therefore complete.}. Now we can
define continuity.

\paragraph{Definition} A function $f$ is \emph{continuous} iff it is
monotone and preserves the $\lub{ }$ of all $\omega$-chains: i.e.
assume any chain $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \omega}$, then:

\begin{equation*}
\lub{n \in \omega} \, (f \, x_n) \eq f \, (\lub{n \in \omega} \, x_n)
\end{equation*}

Just as with monotonicity, there are several ways to interpret
this. One way is to say that what a function does on a chain, it must
also do on the chain's limit, as with \hs{map} on increasingly longer
lists. Another is to say that a function cannot produce finite output by
inspecting infinite input: there is no function
\hs{isFinite :: [a] -> Bool} returning \hs{True} on finite lists and
\hs{False} on infinite lists. On the increasing chain
$$ \bot \sqsubseteq x_0 \hs{:} \bot \sqsubseteq x_0 \hs{:} x_1 \hs{:} \bot
\sqsubseteq \cdots$$
the function \hs{isFinite} returns \hs{True} (or $\bot$), but the
limit should return \hs{False}, so this is not a continuous function.

An interesting formulation of Church's Thesis in terms of continuity
is given by Plotkin \cite{domains}:

\begin{center}
\emph{A function is continuous iff it is physically feasible.}
\end{center}

This means that all computable functions are contiuous, and the other
way around. The conclusion for us is that all Haskell functions are
continuous.

\subsection{Unsafe Haskell}
In GHC, you can use \hs{unsafePerformIO} and \hs{catch} from
\hs{Control.Exception} and other tricks to unsafely catch errors
(bottoms). With this machinery it is possible to write a function
\hs{isBottom :: a -> Bool} to catch calls to \hs{undefined}, pattern
match failures, etcetera. In addition, some non-termination some can
also be catched in Haskell because of the \emph{blackhole} run time
object that replaces a \emph{thunk} that is being currently
evaluated. It does not and indeed cannot cover all non terminating
functions because of the undecidability of the Halting problem.

The domain theoretic results remain; one can see $\bot$ as another,
albeit inconveniently inspected, constructor to every data type. All
patterns are exhaustive: every function has an implicit match any
pattern to $\bot$.  Then we add a \emph{true} bottom to the domain
denotes the uncatchable bottoms; undeterminable non termination. With
this setting all Haskell functions are continuous with respect to the
\emph{true} bottoms. But for the rest of this thesis, we shall only
consider pure and safe Haskell functions.

\subsection{Monotonicity as Verification}

Continuity is a concept that is hard to express in first order logic:
it in not able to express countability. We can come close with an
axiomatization of set theory, but we leave that issue and focus on
monotonicity. A way to verify the translation is to add axioms to the
generated theory describing the $\sqsubseteq$ relation, and axioms
that asserts that each function is monotone. An automated theorem
prover could not easily show that it is a satisfiable theory since it
will normally only have infinite models. However, a long run without
any counter model could be seen as a witness for a successful
translation in this respect.
