\section{Domain Theory}
\label{sec:domaintheory}

This section is stand alone, and could be skipped especially if you
already know the basics of domain theory: comp\-lete partial orders,
monotonicity and continuity.  It explains these concepts and discusses
how it can be used to verify the translation, furthermore it is used
as a reference in for later sections that rely on concepts from domain
theory.

The values of every data type are ordered on how much ``information''
they contain. The least element bottom, denoted $\bot$, contains least
information. It corresponds to all kinds of crashes in Haskell; use of
\hs{undefined}, non-termination and non exhaustive pattern matches.
Different constructors hold different information, so they are not
related by the ordering; this ordering is partial. Such orders are
reflexive, transitive and anti-symmetric. The ordering is written
$\sqsubseteq$, sometimes with a subscript indicating the type.

}
\end{wrapfigure}
For the \hs{Bool} data type the partial order can be drawn as a
diagram in Figure \ref{fig:boolcpo}.  From the picture it is
understood that $\bot$ is the least element, and the line from it to
\hs{False} means that $\bot \sqsubseteq \hs{False}$, since $\bot$ is
below $\hs{False}$. Correspondingly for $\hs{True}$, the diagram tells
us that $\bot \sqsubseteq \hs{True}$. It can also been seen that
$\hs{True} \nsqsubseteq \hs{False}$; they are unrelated since there is
no line between them. This kind of diagram is called a Hasse Diagram.

\end{wrapfigure} %\end{figure}
For tuples and other constructors that take other data types as
parameters, the ordering is:
\begin{equation*}
\hstup{x_0}{y_0} \sqsubseteq_{(a,b)} \hstup{x_1}{y_1} \text{\quad iff \quad}
x_0 \sqsubseteq_a x_1 \text{\w and \w} y_0 \sqsubseteq_b y_1
\end{equation*}

The Hasse Diagram for the \hs{(Bool,Bool)} values can be seen in
Figure \ref{fig:boolboolcpo}. Here \hs{True} is abbreviated for \hs{T}
and similarly for \hs{False}. It is not flat as the one for \hs{Bool};
it can be seen as three dimensional. On the lowest layer the only
value is $\bot$, on the next layer $\hstup{\bot}{\bot}$. Above that
the tuples with one $\bot$, and finally the total values at the
top.

\subsection{Monotonicity}
 An important property all safe Haskell functions have is that they are
monotone with respect to this ordering.

\paragraph{Definition} A function $f$ is \emph{monotone} iff

\begin{equation*}
\faa{x}{y} \quad x \sqsubseteq y \quad \Rightarrow \quad f(x) \sqsubseteq f(y).
\end{equation*}

Monotonicity can be understood in many ways. One way to see it is if you have
two inputs to a function, one containing \emph{less} information that
the other, it is impossible to return \emph{more} information from the
input with less information.

One simple example of a consequence of monotonicity is the
impossibility to make a function \hs{isBottom :: a -> Bool}, returning
\hs{True} if the argument is bottom, and \hs{False} otherwise:

\note{rewrite with code}
\begin{align*}
& \hs{isBottom} \w :: \hs{a} \rightarrow \hs{Bool} \\
& \hs{isBottom} \w \bot = \hs{True} \\
& \hs{isBottom} \w x \, = \hs{False}, \qquad x \neq \bot
\end{align*}

\noindent
Since $\bot \sqsubseteq x$ for any $x$, then by monotonicity we must
necessarily have
$$\hs{isBottom} \w \bot \sqsubseteq \hs{isBottom} \w x.$$
Take any non-bottom $x$, then this equation gives
$\hs{True} \sqsubseteq \hs{False}$, which is false. Hence
\hs{isBottom} is not monotone.

\subsection{Continuity}
Another domain theoretic property that Haskell functions have is that
they are continuous. This is a property that gives us insight in how
functions behave on infinite input.  To describe this, we need to
consider the partial order of a data type with infinite values. The
prime candidate \hs{data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat} is used and Hasse
Diagram can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:natcpo}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\input{natcpo}
\caption{
    The (complete) partial order for \texttt{Nat}, with \hs{inf = Succ inf.}
    \label{fig:natcpo}
}
\end{figure}

At the top we have the infinite value \hs{inf}, defined in Haskell as
\hs{inf = Succ inf}. Here \hs{inf} is the \emph{limit} of a sequence
of $\sqsubseteq$ inclusions. We will consider $\omega$-chains, chains with the same number of elements as
$\omega$, the natural numbers.

\newpage

An example of a chain which has the infinite natural number \hs{inf}
as its limit is:

\begin{equation*}
\bot \sqsubseteq
\hs{Succ} \, \bot \sqsubseteq
\hs{Succ} \, (\hs{Succ} \, \bot) \sqsubseteq
\hs{Succ} \, (\hs{Succ} \, (\hs{Succ} \, \bot)) \sqsubseteq
\cdots
\end{equation*}

This chain could succinctly be written $\langle \hs{Succ}^n \, \bot
\rangle_{n \in \omega}$.  Here $\hs{Succ}^n$ means $n$ applications of
the \hs{Succ} constructor. The limit is written $\lub{n \in
  \omega}(\hs{Succ}^n \, \bot)$ and is equal to \hs{inf}, where
$\lub{}$ is the least upper bound. All elements in the chain satisfy
the property of being less than or equal to the limit: $\hs{Succ}^n \,
\bot \sqsubseteq \hs{inf}$.

A partial order is a complete partial order iff there is a limit for
every $\omega$ chain. All data types in Haskell are complete partial
orders. Notice that the number of $\omega$ chains are infinite for all
non-empty data types. For booleans, there are chains that start with
$bottom$ and shifts to $\hs{True}$ or $\hs{False}$ at some point. For
the natural number data type, it is not necessary to add exactly one
\hs{Succ} constructor at every inclusion. For lists, the chains can be
even more involving:

\newcommand\trueV{\hs{True}}
\newcommand\consV{\hs{:}}
\newcommand\falseV{\hs{False}}

\begin{equation*}
  \trueV \consV \bot    \consV \bot                    \sqsubseteq
  \trueV \consV \bot    \consV \trueV \consV \bot      \sqsubseteq
  \trueV \consV \falseV \consV \trueV \consV \bot      \sqsubseteq
  \cdots
\end{equation*}

This could be the starting chain of an infinite list of booleans with $\trueV$
and $\falseV$ interleaved. Now, let us define continuity.

\begin{comment}
\footnonte{Notice that the data type \hs{data StrictNat = Zero |
    Succ !StrictNat} is flat and therefore complete.}.
\end{comment}

\paragraph{Definition} A function $f$ is \emph{continuous} iff it is
monotone and preserves the $\lub{ }$ of all $\omega$-chains: i.e.
assume any chain $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \omega}$, then:

\begin{equation*}
\lub{n \in \omega} \, (f \, x_n) \eq f \, (\lub{n \in \omega} \, x_n)
\end{equation*}

Just as with monotonicity, there are several ways to interpret
this. One way is to say that what a function does on a chain, it must
also do on the chain's limit, as with \hs{map} on increasingly longer
lists. Another is to say that a function cannot produce finite output by
inspecting infinite input: there is no function
\hs{isFinite :: [a] -> Bool} returning \hs{True} on finite lists and
\hs{False} on infinite lists. On the increasing chain
$$ \bot \sqsubseteq x_0 \hs{:} \bot \sqsubseteq x_0 \hs{:} x_1 \hs{:} \bot
\sqsubseteq \cdots$$
the function \hs{isFinite} returns \hs{True} (or $\bot$), but the
limit should return \hs{False}, so this is not a continuous function.

An interesting formulation of Church's Thesis in terms of continuity
is given by Plotkin \cite{domains}:

\begin{center}
\emph{A function is continuous iff it is physically feasible.}
\end{center}

This means that all computable functions are continuous, and the other
way around. The conclusion for us is that all Haskell functions are
continuous.

\subsection{Unsafe Haskell}
In GHC, you can use \hs{unsafePerformIO} and \hs{catch} from
\hs{Control.Exception} and other tricks to ``unsafely'' catch errors
(bottoms). With this machinery it is possible to write a function
\hs{isBottom :: a -> Bool} to catch calls to \hs{undefined}, pattern
match failures, etcetera. In addition, some non-termination can also
be determined in Haskell because of the \emph{blackhole} run time
object that replaces a \emph{thunk} that is being currently
evaluated. But this machinery does not and indeed cannot cover all non
terminating functions because of the undecidability of the halting
problem.

The domain theoretic results remain; in this setting $\bot$ can be
seen as another, albeit inconveniently inspected, constructor to every
data type. All patterns are exhaustive: every function has an implicit
match any pattern to $\bot$.  Then we add a \emph{true} least element
to the domain denoting the uncatchable bottoms; undeterminable non
termination. With this setting all Haskell functions are continuous
with respect to the \emph{true} bottoms. However, proving properties
about such programs is difficult as the order of evaluation now
matters. For the rest of this thesis, only pure and ``safe'' Haskell
functions are considered.

\subsection{Monotonicity as Verification}

A way to verify the translation is to add axioms to the generated
theory describing the $\sqsubseteq$ relation, and axioms that asserts
that each function is monotone. An automated theorem prover could not
easily show that it is a satisfiable theory since it will normally
only have infinite models. However, a long run without any counter
model could be seen as a witness for a successful translation in this
respect.  On the other hand, continuity is a concept that is hard to
express in first order logic. We can come close with an axiomatisation
of set theory, but it is beyond the scope of this thesis.
