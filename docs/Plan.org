* Week 44 (31 Oct - 6 Nov)
** DONE Write project proposal
** DONE Hand in project proposal
CLOSED: [2011-11-04 Fri 11:45] SCHEDULED: <2011-11-01 Tue>

*** DONE Mail Graham
CLOSED: [2011-11-02 Wed 08:50]

SCHEDULED: <2011-11-01 Tue>
About time plan, merge-sort implementation, approx lemma and
typeclasses.

** TODO Write more examples
SCHEDULED: <2011-11-02 Wed>
*** DONE Add merge sort
CLOSED: [2011-11-02 Wed 10:22]
*** TODO Feldspar examples
*** TODO Case-Analysis from Moa's project
[[http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/lemmadiscovery/case_results.php][Case-Analysis Results]]
**** TODO Translate to Haskell
**** TODO Translate Theorems to Haskell
** TODO Comparison with Zeno
*** DONE Write how Zeno compares to this project
CLOSED: [2011-11-02 Wed 10:42]
*** TODO How does Zeno handle typeclasses?
SCHEDULED: <2011-11-02 Wed>

** TODO Haskell $\rightarrow$ Core
The translation should cover most of the examples
SCHEDULED: <2011-11-05 Sat>
*** DONE Lambdas
CLOSED: [2011-11-05 Sat 14:04]
**** TODO More tests needed
*** DONE Sections
CLOSED: [2011-11-05 Sat 15:41]
*** DONE Add all functions in scope for mutually recursive let/where
CLOSED: [2011-11-05 Sat 15:21]
*** TODO Output declarations together with its definitions
Accompany a function with its produced floated definitions
*** DONE Support for pattern matching on lists
CLOSED: [2011-11-05 Sat 12:45]
*** DONE Don't recalculate FV for binds
CLOSED: [2011-11-05 Sat 15:21]
Currently, when something needs to be floated uses a where-clause, the
FV looks inside the definition of the where's definition. This could
be stored to avoid recalulation and to avoid termination issues.
*** TODO Tidy up code and comment
*** TODO Generate code and test
*** TODO Pattern binds
(x,y) = e
Here, x and y can occur in e. This can be translated with
e' x y = e
x = case e' x y of (x,y) -> x
y = case e' x y of (x,y) -> y
In a let/where stmt there can of course be more free variables in e.
*** Future plans:
Just a reminder what is not currently subject for translation
**** List comprehensions
**** Do notation
**** Let in guards
**** Typeclasses
**** Records
**** As-patterns, and
** TODO Read about different proving techniques

* Week 45 (7 Nov - 13 Nov)
** DONE Meeting with Koen
CLOSED: [2011-11-07 Mon 14:50]
Discuss different proving techniques

Present Haskell $\rightarrow$ Core translation
SCHEDULED: <2011-11-07 Mon>
** TODO Write report about translation to FOL
SCHEDULED: <2011-11-08 Tue>
** TODO Implement proving techniques
*** First steps:
Total and finite input

Later versions can use QuickCheck to see if it holds for partial
input, see paper by NAD et al Chasing Bottoms, and prove with the
given information and prove with finite, infinite, partial and total.

Implement simple proof techniques: approximation lemma, structural
induction, fixpoint induction and [[http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/basis1/node11.html][recursion induction]]
SCHEDULED: <2011-11-11 Fri>
** TODO Bug Sven until registered on course

** Evaluation of proving techniques
SCHEDULED: <2011-11-14 Mon>

translation?
SCHEDULED: <2011-11-14 Mon>
