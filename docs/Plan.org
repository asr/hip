About time plan, merge-sort implementation, approx lemma and
typeclasses.


** TODO Write more examples
SCHEDULED: <2011-11-02 Wed>
*** DONE Add merge sort
CLOSED: [2011-11-02 Wed 10:22]
*** TODO Feldspar examples
*** TODO Case-Analysis from Moa's project
[[http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/lemmadiscovery/case_results.php][Case-Analysis Results]]
**** TODO Translate to Haskell
**** TODO Translate Theorems to Haskell
** TODO Comparison with Zeno

CLOSED: [2011-11-02 Wed 10:42]
*** TODO How does Zeno handle typeclasses?
SCHEDULED: <2011-11-02 Wed>

** TODO Haskell $\rightarrow$ Core
The translation should cover most of the examples
SCHEDULED: <2011-11-05 Sat>
*** TODO Lambdas
*** TODO Sections
*** TODO Add all functions in scope for mutually recursive let/where
*** TODO Output declarations together with its definitions
Accompany a function with its produced floated definitions
*** TODO Support for pattern matching on lists
*** TODO Don't recalculate FV for binds
Currently, when something needs to be floated uses a where-clause, the
FV looks inside the definition of the where's definition. This could
be stored to avoid recalulation and to avoid termination issues.
*** TODO Tidy up code and comment
*** Future plans:
Just a reminder what is not currently subject for translation
**** List comprehensions
**** Do notation
**** Let in guards
**** Typeclasses
**** Records 
**** As-patterns, and
** TODO Read about different proving techniques
