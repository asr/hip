be stored to avoid recalulation and to avoid termination issues.

*** Remove unnecessary definitions when proving
Eprover gets totally lost when you have unnecessary axioms in scope.
These needs to be disabled somehow. Probably not predicates, easy to
get inconsistencies with a definition being activated and decativated.
But for each thing you want to prove, one will need to know every
function and datatype it depends on.

Induction by well-ordering

Induction by negation
$$P(Empty) \rightarrow P(left(a)) \wedge P(right(a))$$
$$\neg P(a)$$

For admissible P:
$$P(\bot) , P(0) , (\forall i . P(i) \rightarrow P(i^+)) \rightarrow$$
$$\forall i \in \mathbb{N}^{finite}_{\bot} . P(i)$$
Meta-theorem from Domain theory gives:
$$\forall i \in \mathbb{N}_{\bot} . P(i)$$

By negation:
$$P(0) \wedge P(\bot) \rightarrow P(pred(a))$$


Termination by well-ordering!

** DONE Update examples with the new
** DONE Proving Work
*** DONE Solve induction by depth problem
*** DONE Add approximation lemma
Either use this using typeclasses or simply add
approxType :: Nat -> Type a -> Type a
to the code
Solved by generating the approximation code. This was really simple.

This could be triggered by

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
prop_map_iterate :: (a -> a) -> a -> Prop (Approx (List a))
prop_map_iterate f x = prove (map f (iterate f x) :=: iterate f (f x))
#+END_SRC

where type Approx a = a or some equivalent. Maybe it isn't necessary
to add: no types are concrete so you only option is to use
approximation lemma.
*** DONE Make an own timeout and able user to specify timeout
*** DONE Run proofs in different threads
Still some work to do here: this only sparks thread for a single
proof technique (approx lemma

*** Approximation lemma solution
Don't introduce a new pointer name, rather introduce a new function
with arity 1. Approximation lemma for lists then becomes:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
approx([]) = []
approx(x:xs) = x : h xs
#+END_SRC

Hypothesis: axiom , h lhs = h rhs
Step: conjecture , approx lhs = approx rhs

Futhermore, it is possible to inline the whole definition of approx
instead of treating this as a function.
*** Negated induction nat machine
#+BEGIN_SRC tptp
~P(a)
a = zero | P(pred(a))
a = zero | a = succ(zero) | P(pred(pred(a))
% ^ P(pred(a)) comes from above if a = succ(zero)
#+END_SRC

...

#+BEGIN_SRC tptp
~P(a)
Q(x,y)    => a = x    | Q(succ(x),pred(y))
Q(zero,y) => a = zero | P(pred(y))
Q(zero,a)
#+END_SRC

(I think I remember correctly)
However, this is pretty difficult to generalize to datatypes with

*** Fixpoint induction solution
plus (S n) m = S (plus n m)

then rewrite plus with a newly created plus' with arity 2 like this:

plus (S n) m = S (plus' n m)

Then in order to prove some P which uses plus:

P(bottom) & (P(plus') => P(plus))
*** More examples needed
**** More interesting recursion
**** Using the nice pattern-matching compiler
**** Weird datatypes
Like the domain for lambda calculus:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data D = Fun (D -> D) | Bottom
compile :: Expr -> D
#+END_SRC
*** Lexicographic induction
$(x,y) \le (x',y')$ iff $x \le x' \vee (x = x' & y \le y')$

This does not give a normal "induction matrix", but these proof
obligations:

#+BEGIN_SRC tptp
P(zero)
![y,y'] : P(x,y) => P(suc(x),y')      or y == y'?
![x] : P(x,y) => P(x,suc(y))
#+END_SRC

Um, is this right? I'm a bit confused now.
*** Symmetric induction for commutativity
#+BEGIN_SRC tptp
P(zero,zero)
P(m,zero) => P(suc(m),zero)
P(zero,n) => P(zero,suc(n))
P(m,n) & P(suc(m),n) & P(m,suc(n)) => P(suc(m),suc(n))
#+END_SRC

For trees data T = T * T | L the two * case is:
#+BEGIN_SRC tptp
axioms: P(a,c)
        P(a,d)
        P(b,c)
        P(b,d)
        P(a*b,c)
        P(a*b,d)
        P(a,c*d)
        P(b,c*d)
negated_conjecture: ~ P(a*b,c*d)
#+END_SRC
*** Recursion induction (Plotkin)
To prove x + y = y + x try to prove it with +~ defined as

+~ = flip +

From the equations for + we get this to prove:

zero  +~ y = y , ie, y + zero = y

suc x +~ y = suc (x +~ y), ie, y + suc x = suc (y + x),

which is exactly the movesuc lemma. And if these two are proved (by
induction) we get by Recursion Induction that x + y = y + x. Nice!
*** Try vampire prover
Koen also talked about the author of Prover9 and the memory ceremony
for him and his work on Otter.
*** Agda in the report
It is nice to say that Agda was used to verify that some things were
provable before implementing proof techniques. Like the proof for plus
commmutativity without lemma.
*** Make and remove user specifications of tecniques
Figure out a way for the user to specify which proving techniques she
would like to use. But these should always be optional and if none are
supplied, all applicable techniques should be tried.

*** DONE Smarter handling if bottom cannot be proved
CLOSED: [2011-12-02 Fri 17:00]
Simple induction can answer if it was able to prove the bottom case or
not.
*** TODO Tell the prover how long time it will have.
Koen said that this is important for vampire, does eprover have the
same functionality?

Eprover has --cpu-limit and --soft-cpu-limit that with arguments
in seconds. Cpu-limit only terminates the program, and soft cpu limit
prints out unprocesses clauses. This could or could not give a hint
on where the prover got stuck.
*** TODO Simple induction on several variables
Combine this with the auto-depth problem. This would be nice

*** DONE Fixpoint induction
CLOSED: [2011-11-22 Tue 17:20]
To prove P(f) = ! [xs] : lhs(f) = rhs(f):

Prove P(bottom_n) where bottom_n is a function with same arity as f
defined as bottom_n(..) = bottom.

If f is the function we do fixpoint induction over, defined as

f xs = chi(f,xs) + other definitions which, at a first implementation,
may not call f to make things simple. Then define redefine f as:

f xs = chi(f',xs)  where f' is fresh and same arity as f.

Then all you need to show is P(f') => P(f).

Machinery needed:
**** Make bottom_n
**** Instantiate P with a function
**** Make f xs = chi(f',xs) from f xs
**** Find all called functions from lhs and rhs to find fixpoint candidates
**** Check if a function is recursive in itself
(otherwise fixpoint induction typically won't work)
*** TODO Add lemmas from previous proofs
For instance *-assoc for nat needs +-assoc for nat. Only
add lemmas if they hold for bottom? Should the user specify
which lemmas it needs to include?
*** TODO Recursive structure of function -> induction principle
A hard problem! Could also be used to show that functions terminate

* Week 48 (28 Nov - 4 Dec)
** DONE Statistics

On how many problems were proved, and which techniques succeeded.

** DONE Properties with pointers
CLOSED: [2011-12-03 Sat 17:00]
If you want to show
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
id = curry . uncurry
#+END_SRC
There will be no proof found. It would be nice if you could add
#+BEGIN_SRC tptp
fof(appbottom,axiom,! [X] : ('ptr.app'('_|_',X) = '_|_')).
fof(extequality,axiom,! [F,G,X] : (('ptr.app'(F,X) = 'ptr.app'(G,X)) => F = G)).
#+END_SRC
But extequality (with or without bottom) leads to inconsistencies.
appbottom in itself does not seem to lead inconsistencies, but it does
not help at this point.

Futhermore, the property is not necessarily true:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Prelude> (uncurry . curry) (\(a,b) -> 1) undefined
1
Prelude> id (\(a,b) -> 1) undefined
 * Exception: Prelude.undefined
Prelude> id (\(~(a,b)) -> 1) undefined
1
#+END_SRC
But with the definitions I had in Functions.hs was more strict
definitions of uncurry/curry:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
Functions Prelude> (uncurry . curry) (\(a,b) -> 1) undefined
*Exception: Prelude.undefined
Functions Prelude> (uncurry . curry) (\(~(a,b)) -> 1) undefined
*Exception: Prelude.undefined
*Functions Prelude> id (\(~(a,b)) -> 1) undefined
1
#+END_SRC

Is this a better definition of extensional equality?
#+BEGIN_SRC tptp
fof(exteq,axiom,! [F,G]: ( (! [X] : (app(F,X) = app(G,X))) => F = G)).
#+END_SRC
Probably :)

* Week 49 (5 Dec - 11 Dec)
** Meeting with Koen
*** Recursion-induction
if f is defined as F(f'), and g=G(g'), then if we prove that
g=F(g'), then we know that F(f') <= F(g'). If both g and and f
terminate, then <= is an equivalence. So this only works for
terminating propertes. We need some way to flag terminating functions.

It is also not really sure what it means for a Haskell function to
terminate. We could have that a function terminates for all finite
input, as then map terminates, but also take n terminates for all
finite n, regardless of size of the input list. So it is not
completely obvious what it means to be a terminating Haskell function.
*** Induction over (f : A -> B) -> P f
Let's say we want to prove $P(f)$ where
$f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$.

To show
$$\forall f.P(f)$$
then we can do
$$\forall n.\forall f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow
                        \mathbb{N} \cap {0..n}$$
If P is admissible.

To by induction, maybe we can do (Koen)
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
P(\x -> 0)

P(f) => P(\x.if x == a then S (f x) else f x)
#+END_SRC
i.e we raise it at one exclusive point.
*** Extensional equality and seq
With seq it is possible to distinguish these two functions:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
f = bottom
g = \x -> bottom
#+END_SRC
by doing this
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
f `seq` () = bottom
g `seq` () = ()
#+END_SRC
But seq is the only function that can do this. We can use extensional
equality and Prop (a -> b) ~= a -> Prop b if restrict ourselves to
Haskell without seq. Alternatively, this could be done with a flag,
--enable-seq, that prevenst Prop (a -> b) => a -> Prop b and
extensional equality.
*** Irrefutable patterns
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
fst (x,y) = x
snd (x,y) = y
uncurry1 f t      = f (fst t) (snd t)
uncurry2 f (x,y)  = f x y
uncurry3 f ~(x,y) = f x y
#+END_SRC
Here, uncurry1 and uncurry3 are equal, but uncurry2 is too strict.

** DONE Make Prop testable.
CLOSED: [2011-12-05 Mon 15:45]
Also put this in some AutoPrelude. Then we can remove prove,
and just make =:= be the function.
** DONE Add disproving

=/= could do for that.
** TODO Fixpoint induction on all subsets of recursive functions
prove (x + y == y + x)

** TODO Fixpoint induction for terminating programs
Koen's conjecture is if f is a termiatring program, then lfp f = gfp f
and we have the following rule

$$
\exists a . a \le fix f \rightarrow P(a)
\, \wegde \,
P(x) \rightarrow P(f x)
$$
$$ \Rightarrow P(fix f) $$

Then it holds for finite, total values.

Let the user specify when a function is terminating for sure, by some
notation:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
terminates = (+)
#+END_SRC haskell

** TODO Fixpoint induction on different functions
$$P(\bot,\bot) \, \wedge \, P(x,y) \rightarrow P(f x,f y)$$
$$ \Rightarrow P(fix f,fix g)$$
Notice that the two $\bot$ can be of different arity

** TODO Induction in several variables, and in more depth
This should also fire the definition of integers (data Z = P Nat | N Nat)

** TODO Examples
*** TODO Hinze's last papers about coinduction
A lot of interesting stuff in his papers
*** TODO Dixon's PhD thesis
Nat and Ordinals with exponentials

A noticeable difference with my work and this is Dixon combines
finding lemmas (by rippling for instance) and the way to prove
them. (Or so it seems) The advantage of our approach is that we do not
need to worry HOW to prove something, the ATP will take care of that,
only WHAT to prove.

However, Nat has a sorting... I guess we cannot prove that sort sorts
without having lemmas for < <= etc.
